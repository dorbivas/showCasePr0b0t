# Description

```md
'Lets-Meet' is an open-source platform that is meant to be used by everyone.
The platform is meant to help the users to manage meetings of different types
and centralize related information that links to those meetings such as files.
```

# Motivation

```md
There is difficulty coordinating meetings between different people,
whether it’s a meeting between teammates, meeting between a few students, 
catching up with friends or family and more, due to a busy schedule
that varies from person to person.
Therefore, to solve this problem, we would like to develop “Lets Meet”.
```
